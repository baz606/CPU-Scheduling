Instructions to compile:

The program using C++11 standard and the code is separated in two cpp files so the command you can use the compile properly is:
    g++ -std=c++11 -o main *.cpp

You can then run the program by ./main < INPUTFILE
where INPUTFILE should be one of the files in the "input-files" directory
